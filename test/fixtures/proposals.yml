    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
    
    October 25, 2007
    
    Ms. HIRONO introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Education and Labor
    
    A BILL
    
    To provide for a statewide early childhood education professional development and career system, and for other purposes.
    
          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
    
    SECTION 1. GRANTS AUTHORIZED.
    
          Title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    
    `PART C--EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CAREER SYSTEM
    
    `SEC. 231. SHORT TITLE.
    
          `This part may be cited as the `Early Education Workforce Act'.
    
    `SEC. 232. FINDINGS.
    
          `Congress makes the following findings:
    
                `(1) According to 2005 data from the Bureau of the Census, nearly 12,000,000 children under the age of 5 are in some type of child care arrangement.
    
                `(2) The knowledge and skills of individuals in early childhood education programs, including administrators, directors, teachers, and other staff, is a predictor of the ability to provide high quality experiences for children in such programs.
    
                `(3) Early childhood professionals enter the early childhood education field through various paths. Some individuals have completed early childhood education professional preparation programs prior to working in an early childhood education program.
    
                `(4) The delivery system of education, professional development, and training for early childhood educators has disparate standards and funding.
    
                `(5) Funding for such education, professional development, and training is fragmented, sporadic, and insufficient.
    
                `(6) Compensation (salaries and benefits) for early childhood education program personnel is woefully inadequate, and creates a crisis in the attraction and retention of high quality staff and directors.
    
                `(7) To attract and retain qualified adults to work in early childhood programs, there must be viable career lattices that provide opportunities for continued professional development and increased compensation.
    
    `SEC. 233. PURPOSE.
    
          `It is the purpose of this part--
    
                `(1) to improve the quality of the early childhood education workforce by creating a statewide early childhood education professional development and career system linked to appropriate compensation for early childhood education program staff, directors, and administrators; and
    
                `(2) to create--
    
                      `(A) a coherent system of core competencies, pathways to qualifications, credentials, degrees, quality assurances, access, and outreach for early childhood education program staff, directors, and administrators;
    
                      `(B) articulation agreements so that early childhood education professionals can have smooth transitions among degrees; and
    
                      `(C) compensation initiatives for individuals working in an early childhood education program that reflect the individuals' credentials, degrees and experience.
    
    `SEC. 234. DEFINITION OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAM.
    
          `In this part, the term `early childhood education program' means--
    
                `(1) a family child care program, center-based child care program, State pre-kindergarten program, school program, or other out-of-home early childhood development care program, that--
    
                      `(A) is licensed or regulated by the State; and
    
                      `(B) serves 2 or more unrelated children from birth until entry into kindergarten;

    RESOLUTION
    
    Celebrating the accomplishments of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, and recognizing the need to continue pursuing the goal of educational opportunities for women and girls.
    
    Whereas 35 years ago, on June 23, 1972, the Education Amendments of 1972 containing title IX was signed into law by the President;
    
    Whereas Representatives Patsy T. Mink and Edith Green led the successful fight in Congress to pass this legislation;
    
    Whereas title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the administration of any education program receiving Federal financial assistance;
    
    Whereas remarkable gains have been made to ensure equal opportunity for women and girls under the inspiration and mandate of title IX;
    
    Whereas title IX serves as the nondiscrimination principle in education;
    
    Whereas title IX has moved this Nation closer to the fulfillment of access and opportunities for women and girls in all aspects of life;
    
    Whereas title IX has increased educational opportunities for women and girls, resulting in improved graduation rates, increased access to professional schools and nontraditional fields of study, and improved employment opportunities;
    
    Whereas title IX has increased opportunities for women and girls in sports, leading to greater access to competitive sports, and building strong values such as teamwork, leadership, discipline, work ethic, self-sacrifice, pride in accomplishment, and strength of character;
    
    Whereas on October 29, 2002, title IX was named the `Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act' in recognition of Representative Mink's heroic, visionary, and tireless leadership in developing and winning passage of title IX; and
    
    Whereas 35 years of progress under title IX is widely acknowledged, but because women continue to earn less for work than men with the same educational background; sexual harassment remains pervasive in schools and on college campuses; women and girls face substantial barriers in pursuing high-wage fields such as science, technology, engineering, and math; and women and girls' sports teams do not receive an equal share of resources, including fewer recruiting and scholarship dollars at the college level; and athletic participation opportunities still lag behind those provided for men, there is still much work to be done if the promise of title IX is to be fulfilled: Now, therefore, be it
    
          Resolved, That the House of Representatives celebrates--
    
                (1) the accomplishments of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, in increasing opportunities for women and girls in all facets of education; and
    
                (2) the magnificent accomplishments of women and girls in sports.

    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
    
    August 1, 2007
    
    Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California, Mr. ANDREWS, Mr. TIERNEY, and Mrs. DAVIS of California) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Education and Labor
    
    A BILL
    
    To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to improve early education.
    
          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
    
    SECTION 1. EARLY EDUCATION.
    
          The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended by adding at the end the following:
    
    `TITLE X--EARLY EDUCATION
    
    `SEC. 10001. SHORT TITLE.
    
          `This title may be cited as the `Providing Resources Early for Kids Act of 2007' or the `PRE-K Act'.
    
    `SEC. 10002. FINDINGS.
    
          `Congress finds the following:
    
                `(1) Children's experiences in the first five years of life influence the developing brain and have significant and lasting impact.
    
                `(2) All children deserve access to high quality early learning experiences that can support their cognitive, social, and emotional development and help prepare them to succeed in school and in life.
    
                `(3) Research shows that high quality early education programs can improve early reading and early math skills, decrease grade retention, decrease the need for special education services, and increase the likelihood that children will graduate from high school and become productive members of society.
    
                `(4) The economic benefits of early education experiences are clear and providing parents greater access to high-quality early learning programs will benefit children, families, and our Nation.
    
                `(5) High quality early education programs have well-trained and well-compensated teachers, small class sizes, a full-day program, comprehensive services, family participation, and a research-based curriculum that aligns with strong early learning standards. The quality of State early education programs varies significantly across the country.
    
                `(6) While nearly three-quarters of three- through five-year-olds not in kindergarten spend time in nonparental care each week, research suggests that most are not in high quality settings that meet the full range of their developmental needs.
    
                `(7) A Federal partnership with States--
    
                      `(A) will help increase access to voluntary high quality preschool programs;
    
                      `(B) is a necessary step to improving the Nation's elementary and secondary schools and helping States close the achievement gap and improve graduation rates; and
    
                      `(C) should be a national priority.
    
    `SEC. 10003. EARLY EDUCATION GRANTS.
    
          `(a) Program Established- Each fiscal year, from amounts made available to carry out this title, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall make grants to States to enhance or improve State-funded preschool programs, as defined by the State.
    
          `(b) Allotment-
    
                `(1) DETERMINATION- After making the reservation described under subsection (c), from funds appropriated under section 10011, the Secretary shall make a base allotment to each State that has submitted an approved application and is either--
    
                      `(A) a qualified State (as defined in section 10004(a)); or
    
                      `(B) a selected State (as designated under section 10004(b)).
    
                `(2) AMOUNT- The amount of the base allotment described under paragraph (1) for each State shall be based on the number of children up to age 5 from families with incomes below the poverty line for each State, compared to the number of such children from all States, except that no State shall have a base allotment less than .25 percent of the amounts appropriated under this title.
    
                `(3) BASIS FOR THE BASE ALLOTMENT- The Secretary shall determine the amount of the base allotment determined under paragraph (2) as if every State was to receive a base allotment.
    
                `(4) REMAINDER- In any fiscal year for which not every State is to receive a base allotment, the Secretary shall reallot any funds remaining after the determination of a base allotment under paragraph (2) to each State that has submitted an approved application and is a qualified State. Such remaining funds shall be realloted among such qualified States and shall be determined by comparing the number of children up to age 5 from families with incomes below the poverty line for each such qualified State to such number for all such qualified States.
    
          `(c) Reservation- Prior to making any allotments under subsection (b), the Secretary shall reserve 2.5 percent for the purpose of making grants to Indian tribes and tribal organizations as described in section 10010.
    
    `SEC. 10004. STATE ELIGIBILITY.

                                  `(V) Creative arts.
    
                                  `(VI) Social and emotional development.

                      `(B) The State must have a plan for moving toward a requirement for State-funded preschool programs that each teacher holds a baccalaureate degree in early childhood education within 5 years after the State first receives a grant under this title.
    
                      `(C) The State must, at a minimum, ensure that the average per-child expenditures by the State and its political subdivisions to support State-funded preschool programs for the fiscal year for which the grant is made is equal to, or greater than, such per-child expenditures for the previous fiscal year.
    
                      `(D) The State must, at a minimum, ensure that the total expenditures by the State and its political subdivisions to support State-funded preschool programs for the fiscal year for which the grant is made is equal to, or greater than, such expenditures for the preceding fiscal year.
