GnuPG
=============
	A Command-line wrapper for GnuPG in ruby/rails. The secret decryption key only occupies the working directory for the duration of the decryption.
	
 Requirements:
	GnuPG installed on your box
	A working directory with the public key installed
	An ascii-export of your secret key, for dynamic loading/unloading of the decryption key
	

 Usage:
	For Rails, you'll definitely want to set the absolute paths,
	using RAILS_ROOT/path/to/your/working/directory

	Assuming these options..
	workdir = /tmp/gnupg_test/
	passphrase = uglydonkeys
	

	gnupg = GnuPG.new 	:binary=>"/opt/local/bin/gpg",
						:workdir=>"/tmp/gnupg_test",
						:homedir_pub=>"/tmp/gnupg_test",
						:homedir_sec=>"/tmp/gnupg_test",
						:recipient=>"your uid"
	
	puts plain_message = "no more saddam, haha"
	puts encrypted_message = gnupg.encrypt(plain_message)
	
	#	Load ascii decryption sec key, wherever you may have it
	gnupg.load_key File.read("secret_key.asc")
	puts gnupg.decrypt(encrypted_message,'uglydonkeys') 
	gnupg.drop_key
	
	Thats it! You can, of course, store whatever you want to files, or to the database.
