<h2>TrustFreeDemocracy is a Framework</h2>
<p>The software integrity is designed to function correctly. Every Account is allowed only one vote and one priority. Every account may participate in discussion, support motions, keep track of their representative's affinity, keep track of community affinity. Everyone may view Motions and read all.</p>
<p>Accounts can be certified. This is up to the government owner to assign usernames and password based on lists with high integrity to their people. An account is prepopulated, and a certificate and keycode are distributed accountably. When a user connects this to their account, they can establish a connection with high integrity.</p>
<p>The implementation is up to you</p>
